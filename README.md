# Fraud Detection Module: Generate Transactions

## Overview
This repository contains the Python module `generate_transactions.py`, designed for generating synthetic transaction data for fraud detection modeling. The generated data can be used for training and validating machine learning models, testing APIs, and simulating transaction workflows.

---

## Features
- Generate synthetic transactions with fields like transaction ID, timestamp, amount, credit card number, and location.
- Supports configurable transaction counts.
- Leverages the powerful [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/) library for realistic data.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection.git
   cd fraud-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage
Run the script to generate synthetic transactions:
```bash
python generate_transactions.py
```

### Sample Output
```json
[
  {
    "transaction_id": "d3b07384-d9a4-11ec-9d64-0242ac120002",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-18T14:12:47",
    "amount": 1234.56,
    "credit_card_number": "4532015112830366",
    "card_provider": "Visa",
    "location": "San Francisco"
  },
  ...
]
```

---

## Configuration
You can modify the number of transactions generated by editing the `num_transactions` parameter in the script:
```python
def generate_transaction_data(num_transactions=100):
```

---

## Extending the Module
1. **Add Fields**: Enhance transactions by adding more fields such as merchant names or transaction categories.
2. **Integrate Databases**: Store transactions directly in SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
